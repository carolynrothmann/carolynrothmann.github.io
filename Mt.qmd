```{r}
water_table <- read.csv("data/daily.csv")
```

# Water Table Elevation 

```{r}
water_elevation <- water_table %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(date))
```

```{r}
 water_elevation %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = h_m, color = site)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = .5) +  
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Water Table Elevation Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Elevation (m)")
```

This time series graph showing changes in water table elevation at the Colorado State University Mountain Campus from 2019 - 2024. The periodic spikes seen here shows the seasonal variation likely due to rain or snow melt.

```{r}
rating_data <- read.csv("data/discharege_rating.csv")
```

# Relationship between water stage and discharge.

```{r}
rating_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Stage_CM, y = Q_CM, color = site)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Long Term Rating Curve for Sites 1 and 2",
    x = "Stage (cm)",
    y = "Discharge (cm)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

This rating curve represents the relationship between the stage and discharge between upstream and downstream sites from 2019 - 2024. As the stage increases so does the rate of discharge in Little South Fork Stream.
